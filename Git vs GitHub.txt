Git vs GitHub

Git is the local repository of your project on your local machine
GitHub is the Cloud repository which allows others to access and collaborate on the project


Command Line to make the git folder, add all files to the staging area

>git init
>git add.   // add something to the staging area (checking all the files that are being put in the repo)
>git commit -m "initial commit"  // first commit you would right this (record keeping, snapshot of the current files) 

Add a remote to put it on GitHub

>git remote add origin "some URL.git"
>git push -u origin master        //push uploads to the remote and -u means unconditional







Installing GIT , you will need to add enviornment variables or git will never work

Change the PATH in both the user variables and system variables section in order for Git and many other softwares to work
Go to C users and app data (hidden)
Github folder and find cmd folder
Copy the address and double click on path 
click new and add the path to the user and system variables.

do the same for node.js
(but its going to be in the program files)










Installing MONGO

Go to C disk, and create a folder called data and inside the data create a db folder

go to website mongo and install "Windows server 2008 64bit, without SSl support x64"

Go to cmd and type mongod 
if it doesnt work fix the the enviornment variable (go to C program files mongo db server 3.4 bin)  

On Windows 7 you only need to do the user variables.
